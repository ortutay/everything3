This paper investigates the question of whether \"the NAREIT [index for securitized REITs] and NCREIF [index for direct real estate] returns reflect the same \u2018\u2018real estate factor\u2019\u2019 in the long run and to examine the predictability of the overall NAREIT and overall NCREIF returns.\" The paper applies a variety of time-series statistical methods to argue that the two show a strong long-term cointegral relationship with each other. \r\n\r\nOverall I find the argument pretty convincing, though I didn't follow all of the statistics. One weakness with the paper is that the time series aren't that long (40 years or so), and there's a significant episode of deviation in the 1990s (\"new REIT era\") that gets explained away as a one-off. But explaining away 1/8 of your dataset as a one-off is kind of iffy. And the paper also does something of a similar dance about the 2008 financial crisis (with the advantage of hindsight from 2019, this hand wave looks pretty good, as REITs and direct real estate both recovered in tandem, with REITs leading direct real estate as predicted by the paper). \r\n\r\nI wonder if there is some kind of arbitrage opportunity here between securitized vs. direct real estate investments. This is the kind of thing where there are significant barriers to arbitrage trades -- non-commoditized investment vehicles, large minimum transaction sizes, large transaction costs, etc. You would need a ton of money and a long time horizon to be able to make a good go at it. \r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThis study presents evidence of cointegration between\r\nsecuritized (NAREIT) and direct (NCREIF) real estate total\r\nreturn indices. Since the two real estate indices are cointegrated\r\nwith one another but not with the stock market, real estate\r\ninvestment trusts (REITs) and direct real estate are likely to have\r\nsimilar long-term diversification benefits in a stock portfolio.\r\nOnly direct real estate is found to currently adjust towards the\r\ncointegrating relation, with NAREIT returns leading NCREIF\r\nreturns. However, the results show evidence of the predictability\r\nof NAREIT returns during the 1980s. Additionally, a large and\r\nlong-lasting deviation from the long-run relation between\r\nNAREIT and NCREIF is identified at the beginning of the \u2018\u2018new\r\nREIT era.\u2019\u2019", "link": "https://aresjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/rees.33.1.vr5g6970034l5g88", "img": "https://aresjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/rees.33.1.vr5g6970034l5g88"}}, {"model": "articles.article", "pk": 30, "fields": {"parent_topic": 17, "title": "Property taxes much higher for new owners than old owners.

Today, filing a generic application requires an average of about $5 million and can cost as much as $15 million. This means that a drug may not face brisk generic competition until it exceeds $25 million in annual revenue.
